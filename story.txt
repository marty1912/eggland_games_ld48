It is the year 2345.
The Earth and all of humanity has been destroyed by a superior alien race.
Before the Attack, a science mission was started to Europa, the sixth largest moon in the solar system. 
Europa is covered in ice, but underneath the surface, lies a vast ocean. 
Humans suspected vast amounts of kroterium, a new power source beneath the surface of Europa.
The mission carried a submarine, controlled by the advanced artificial intelligence system yank stuff in outerspace underwater (Y.O.U.).
